# Exercise 36: Dog Years
# (22 Lines)
# It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years. However this
# simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two
# years. As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two
# human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog
# years.
# Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years
# described in the previous paragraph. Ensure that your program works correctly for
# conversions of less than two human years and for conversions of two or more human
# years. Your program should display an appropriate error message if the user enters
# a negative number.

# Exercise 42: Note to Frequency
# (Solved, 39 Lines)
# The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle C, along

# E4 329.63
# F4 349.23
# G4 392.00
# A4 440.00
# B4 493.88
# --------------------
# Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and
# displays the note’s frequency. Your program should support all of the notes listed
# previously.
# Once you have your program working correctly for the notes listed previously
# you should add support for all of the notes from C0 to C8. While this could be
# done by adding many additional cases to your if statement, such a solution is
# cumbersome, inelegant and unacceptable for the purposes of this exercise. Instead,
# you should exploit the relationship between notes in adjacent octaves.
# In particular, the frequency of any note in octave n is half the frequency of the corresponding note in octave n + 1.
# By using this relationship, you should be able to
# add support for the additional notes without adding additional cases to your if
# statement.
# Hint: You will want to access the characters in the note entered by the user
# individually when completing this exercise. Begin by separating the letter from
# the octave. Then compute the frequency for that letter in the fourth octave using
# the data in the table above. Once you have this frequency you should divide it
# by 24−x , where x is the octave number entered by the user. This will halve or

# begins at 0.0, with higher values indicating better performance and resulting in larger
# raises. The value awarded to an employee is either 0.0, 0.4, or 0.6 or more. Values
# between 0.0 and 0.4, and between 0.4 and 0.6 are never used. The meaning associated
# with each rating is shown in the following table. The amount of an employee’s raise
# is $2,400.00 multiplied by their rating.
# Rating Meaning
# 0.0 Unacceptable Performance
# 0.4 Acceptable Performance
# 0.6 or more Meritorious Performance
# Write a program that reads a rating from the user and indicates whether the performance
# for that rating is unacceptable, acceptable or meritorious. The amount
# of the employee’s raise should also be reported. Your program should display an

# Exercise 58: Is It a Leap Year?
# (Solved, 22 Lines)
# Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun
# is actually slightly more than that. As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included
# in some years to correct for this difference. Such years are referred to as leap years.
# The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow:
# • Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
# • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
# • Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
# • All other years are not leap years.
# Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating
# whether or not it is a leap year.

# user = int(input("Enter an year"))
#
# if (user % 4 == 0) and (user % 100 != 0):
#     name = "This is a Leap year"
# elif (user % 100 == 0) and (user % 400 == 0):
#     name = "This is a Leap year"
# else:

# Exercise 59: Next Day
# (50 Lines)
# Write a program that reads a date from the user and computes its immediate successor.
# For example, if the user enters values that represent 2019-11-18 then your program
# should display a message indicating that the day immediately after 2019-11-18 is
# 2019-11-19. If the user enters values that represent 2019-11-30 then the program
# should indicate that the next day is 2019-12-01. If the user enters values that represent
# 2019-12-31 then the program should indicate that the next day is 2020-01-01. The
# date will be entered in numeric form with three separate input statements; one for
# the year, one for the month, and one for the day. Ensure that your program works
# correctly for leap years.




# Exercise 60:What Day of the Week Is January 1?
# (32 Lines)
# The following formula can be used to determine the day of the week for January 1
# in a given year:
# day_of_the_week = (year + floor((year − 1) / 4) − floor((year − 1) / 100) +
# floor((year − 1) / 400)) % 7
# The result calculated by this formula is an integer that represents the day of the
# week. Sunday is represented by 0. The remaining days of the week following in
# sequence through to Saturday, which is represented by 6.
# Use the formula above to write a program that reads a year from the user and
# reports the day of the week for January 1 of that year. The output from your program
# should include the full name of the day of the week, not just the integer returned by
# the formula.


# Exercise 61: Is a License Plate Valid?
# (Solved, 28 Lines)
# In a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist of three uppercase letters
# followed by three digits. When all of the license plates following that pattern had
# been used, the format was changed to four digits followed by three uppercase letters.
# Write a program that begins by reading a string of characters from the user. Then
# your program should display a message indicating whether the characters are valid
# for an older style license plate or a newer style license plate. Your program should
# display an appropriate message if the string entered by the user is not valid for either
# style of license plate.


# Exercise 62: Roulette Payouts
# (Solved, 45 Lines)
# A roulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are red, and two
# are green. The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are numbered 1,
# 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30 32, 34 and 36. The remaining integers
# between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces.
# Many different bets can be placed in roulette. We will only consider the following
# subset of them in this exercise:
# • Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
# • Red versus Black
# • Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for even)
# • 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36
# Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using Python’s
# random number generator. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets
# that must be payed. For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:
# The spin resulted in 13...
# Pay 13
# Pay Black
# Pay Odd
# Pay 1 to 18
# If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display Pay 0
# or Pay 00 without any further output.
